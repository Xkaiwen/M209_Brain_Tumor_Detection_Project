Brain tumor detection is challenging due to variations in tumor appearance and similarity to normal tissues. 
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automate the detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. 
Key steps include image preprocessing to remove noise and enhance quality, followed by training two CNN models. 
The final model achieved 99 percent accuracy, effectively classifying tumors like glioma, meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. 
This system provides a fast and reliable tool to support medical professionals. 
Future improvements will focus on expanding tumor classification, increasing accuracy, and creating a user-friendly web application.
